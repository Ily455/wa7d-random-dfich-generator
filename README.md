This repository is for a python code that generates some low-priced meals for students -mostly- with the cost of each one in a funny way(at least for me) in moroccan accent, so if you're non moroccan you probably won't understand anything.
It doesn't deserve to check it :) as it's very basic, useless, noob and made by a beginner (my first python code ever).
Thanks!
